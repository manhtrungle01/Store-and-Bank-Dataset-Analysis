# Store-and-Bank-Dataset-Analysis
This is a GROUP report. The there are two aims: (i) perform a diverse range of classification machine learning models and (ii) perform data mining 

There are essentially 10 tasks:
1. Problem formulation to have clear goals defined
2. Data Preparation: cleaning, missing value analysis, outlier analysis, and imputation
3. Exploratory Analysis
4. Feature engineering
5. Loss Matrix Assumption
6. Model Building
- Logistic Regression
- Light Gradient Boosting Machine
- Random Forest 
- Model Staking
- Deep Feedforward Neural Network
- CatBoost
7. Model selection based on several dimensions
8. Model evaluation on test set
9. Data mining
- Clustering
- Hypothesis testing 
- Two-way ANOVA
10. Summary

Identical processes were done for both datasets.

Two publicly available dataset were used:
1. Bank dataset: The bank dataset is from a phone campaign to encourage clients to subscribe to a term deposit. 
Each row corresponds to a call made to a customer. The response variable, subscribed, is the last column in the dataset. It indicates whether the client subscribed to a term deposit, which was the objective of the campaign. 
The data dictionary file describes the predictor variables.

2. Fashion store dataset: The store dataset refers to a promotional e-mail campaign. 
Each row refers to a different customer. The response variable, RESP, indicates whether the customer responded to the promotion. Itâ€™s the last column in the data file.
The data dictionary file describes the predictor variables.

Duties involved: Perform analysis, modelling and data mining on the BANK dataset
